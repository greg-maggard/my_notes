# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes

- I've learned how to set up the command line to allow me to navigate 
directories and manipulate files. 
- I've learned how to work on GitHub, creating repositories and cloning them 
into directories on my computer. 
- I've gotten to see the structure of the data science pipeline and how to 
structure projects to help progress through them.
